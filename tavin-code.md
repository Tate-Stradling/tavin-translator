# tavin-code
So what is Tavin code? The technical definition is it's a form of substitution cipher that operates by translating text to and from pairs of vowels.
What does this really mean? It means that each and letter in the English alphabet has a corresponding pair of vowels that it can encrypt to or decrypt from.
For example, the word "testing" encrypts to "aeaaeeaeaueaoe", and "Eoaaeueuao, Oiaoeieuia!" decrypts to "Hello, World!".
